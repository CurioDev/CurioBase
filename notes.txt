Mk.1 notes
-----------

FIXED - Wheel cutout needs to be ~4.8 x 2.7mm 
FIXED - Stepper wheels too small - wires touch the ground
FIXED - Stepper wheels really need rubber/something - so either use rubber wheels or o-ring+3x sheets of ply
FIXED - cutout on faceplate for camera?
Do the sides flex too much? Do they need an elastic band or some kind of support?

Mk. 2 notes
-----------

FIXED Can we get it properly 90 degrees? Move/take down the baseplate by 1mm
FIXED 0.5mm less travel for the bendy clip in the phone holder - can stretch it too far
Strengthen clip - maybe make it longer, make solid part at end bigger
FIXED Phone holder could be a bit less wide at the bottom to make the rubber band easier to access
