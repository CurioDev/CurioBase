Mk.1 notes
-----------

FIXED - Wheel cutout needs to be ~4.8 x 2.7mm 
FIXED - Stepper wheels too small - wires touch the ground
FIXED - Stepper wheels really need rubber/something - so either use rubber wheels or o-ring+3x sheets of ply
FIXED - cutout on faceplate for camera?
Do the sides flex too much? Do they need an elastic band or some kind of support?
